Lidar-based Teach-and-Repeat of Mobile Robot Trajectories

Abstract:

Many robots still use landmarks/markers for navigation
Recent years - only a globally consistent metric map
Not using markers allows more flexible route planning

User taught trajectories represented by anchor points - raw odometry and 2d laser data (no camera)
Scan matching to estimate the offset of the robot position from anchor points
Algorithm calculates error in the configuration space, which is then used in feedback

Methodology

During the teach phase, laser scans of the environment are taken every time the robot
moves a certain distance or rotates by a certain angle. The laser scan contains 2d info
of the environment

For each laser scan, the location (x, y) coordinates are also stored. These form the path to be traced
These coordinates are obtained by measuring velocity during the path and integrating it with time. 
A laser scan and its corresponding position is called an anchor point. 

During the repeat phase, the error at each time step needs to be known. For this, the current position must be estimated
Estimating it as above just from the velocity can lead to drift and is known as dead reckoning.
The next anchor point is found by keeping track of offsets between anchors and by knowing the offset from the current anchor
The offset from this anchor point and the current position is found by matching the current laser scan to the laser scan of the anchor point
Next, the offset between this anchor point and the position coordinate at this time in the STORED path is calculated
Now by adding these two offsets, the error between the actual position and the ideal position is found. This error is applied to a feedback controller 

v = v* - ke. where v is the actual velocity and v* is the stored velocity
e is the error and k is a gain matrix
as v - v* is the time derivative of e, by choosing k to have positive eigenvalues, e can be reduced to 0


Other observations

The anchor point density doesn't influence the result too much
This method of laser scan matching is more accurate than pure encoder based odometry and monte carlo localization
