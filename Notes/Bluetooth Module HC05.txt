hc05 module

hardware:
Vcc to 3.3V pin
ground to ground
rx of module - through voltage divider (5V to 3.3V) - to tx of arduino (pin D11)
(should be any pin other than the tx reserved for serial comm with pc)
tx of module to rx of arduino (pin D10) (any pin other than rx reserved for serial comm with pc - digital pin 0)

while starting, if WAKEUP pin is high, goes into AT mode
can configure module in AT mode but it won't be discoverable
led blinks with 2 sec interval
type AT+INIT to initialize module

(!!!IMPORTANT!!!)if other devices are to connect to the module, the module must be set as a slave
type AT+ROLE=0 to set as slave

type AT+CMODE=1 to let any device connect
type AT+INQ to set the module into inquiry mode
led now blinks more rapidly - 2times per second
It now awaits a connection from other devices

In PC/phone search for bluetooth devices
select HC_MODULE and use the password 1234 to connect

In raspberry pi, click on bluetooth icon > add device > scan for devices > select hc_module > type password
or type sudo bluetoothctl in terminal
agent on
default-agent
scan on
pair <address of module>
trust <address of module>
(it might say that no services are available - that is ok)

in another terminal type: 
sudo rfcomm connect hci0 <addr of mdule>
to connect rfcomm0 to module

in another terminal type
sudo echo "hello" > /dev/rfcomm0
to send "hello" to module

Instead of using rfcomm connect, run the C program bt_test (in /home/pi/Testing ) to connect to the module

Useful info

Password: 1234
name: HC_MODULE

AT+INIT to initialize module
AT+PAIR:<bluetooth addr in uu(8bits),nn(4bits),ll format(12bits)>,<timeout in sec>
AT+DISC to disconnect
AT+STATE to find currect state

if trying to reconnect, disconnect first on both devices

phone bluetooth address: more settings, about phone, scroll to bottom
