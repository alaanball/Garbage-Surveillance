User requirement:

Should 

 1. Survey a distance of 200m in about 15 min

 2. Complete at least 4 round-trips before being recharged

Technical requirement:

Distance between the two points = 200m
Assuming it stops every 3m to capture an image of its surroundings and takes 5s to capture and process the image, the time taken to traverse the path = 4 min
Or an average speed of approximately 75 cm/s

Robot includes
4 DC motors with gearboxes = 4 * 180 gm = 720 gm [1]
4 wheels = 120 gm [2]
chassis = 250 gm [2]  
Raspberry Pi 3 model B (with wifi capability) = 45 gm
Assume total battery weight = 250 gm [3] 
Miscellaneous = 100 gm

Total = approx 1500 gm 

Power and Torque (Detailed calculations with comments in SpecsCalculator.m)

With a maximum angle of inclination = 40 degrees and rolling friction coefficient = 0.05

Top Speed = 75 cm/s
Total Torque =  45
Motor RPM =  200 RPM
Raspberry Pi Battery WH =  8 Wh
RaspPi Battery =  1600 mAh (at 5.1V)
Motor Battery WH = 5 Wh
Motor Battery MAH =  400 mAh
Total Watt-Hours =  13
